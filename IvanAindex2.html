        <p style="color: darkgreen;">
            I am a student at NJIT with the aspirations of one day being a licensed architect.<br> I believe that architects have a moral and ethical obligation to not only our clients, but to our communities and planet as a whole. </br>It is my hope that these years of learning will be able to shape me into the person with the qualities of a person able to exceed these ambitions.
